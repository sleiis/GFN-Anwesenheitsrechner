This is just a small project from me to have better statistics over the attendance at home or on premise during my retraining as an application developer.

The main features are all done, but the code is far from good or clean. I plan to rewrite most of it with the knowledge I learned about OOP and databases.

TO-DO:

- rewrite SQLite logic to use the MVC principle.
- separate the logic and UI according to OOP best practices.
- add detailed statistic panel.

Those are the most important things I need to address.
